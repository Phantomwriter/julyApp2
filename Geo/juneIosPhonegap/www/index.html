            			<strong>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</strong><br>
								Companies realize that social media can help promote their products by reaching a large audience without
								spending a penny. To this end, being able to quickly access a users information makes API resources invaluable.<br>
								Being able to seamlessly transfer user info through the various API’s out there gives giant advantages
								when drawing in and retaining users who just want a simple interface.<br>
						<strong>Login-</strong>By a user allowing their login information to be recorded, it allows companies<br>
								to track the users movements, likes, dis-likes and can make for a unique marketing tool when spreading
								a companies message. Companies can allow the same user login info to their site and make it simpler and 
								easier for users to move along.<br>			

						<strong>Payment-</strong>By storing users “payment type” data, companies make it easier for a user to <br>
								simply say yes to previously stored payment-type information to purchase goods and services. Eliminating the
								hassle of filling out billing information and credit card numbers every time increases the chance of a user 
								purchasing a product or service because it’s just easier for them.<br> 

						<strong>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</strong><br>
								When domains communicate with each other they follow the ‘Same Origin’ policy which prohibits their interaction 
								between each other. This is mostly for the purpose of security. Not allowing one domain affect another.<br>
								The usefulness of JSON-P in this instance allows a payload of JSON data to be transferred from one API to another.<br>
								The “P”, which stands for padding, is function that is “wrapped” around the data. This allows the self contained 
								function the ability to parse the data using javascript. Sending the information with a function allows any other 
								API the ability to render ANY JSON data because the function needed to display the data is already included.<br>

						<strong>JSON-P analogy</strong>
								JSON =a new un-assembled bike with assembly directions written in Chinese.<br>
								-P=is a Chinese speaking mechanic that’s included with the bike and assembles
								it for you so you don’t need to figure out how to read the directions.<br>
						<strong>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</strong><br>
								A few months ago President Obama signed an FAA bill that gives the go-ahead to draw up rules to integrate drones into 
								the country's airspace by October 2015. I had done some research and discovered a few companies that are capitalizing
								on this new trend by creating drones that can be controlled by smartphones.This would be an excellent example of how
								JSON-P could be useful. Having JSON data sent with the function calls included would make it easier for ANY smartphone
								to utilize it’s own native accelerometer to control a drones movements.<br>

						<strong>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</strong><br>
								I wanted to combine the camera and the compass/geolocation features to enhance my app titled "MyGeo".<br>
								It's an app that allows you to take a picture, then record your location. From any other location, you will
								then be able to find that same location following the guidance system and referring to the picture
								for help. My audience would be anyone who wanted to pick a location, take a picture of that location,
								then use geolocation and real-time compass headings to find that exact same location. Pass the information on to friends or
								anyone who wanted to be where you were.<br>
						<strong>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</strong><br>

								As I reflect on lessons learned in regards to the workflow of design and development, I can’t help but be
								tied to old constraints. Doing research on the effective implementation of code vastly differs from research
								that you would do on an essay or term paper.

								I’ve learned that along the path of understanding code and how to utilize it comes a wealth of information
								that offers many different angles and answers to the same problem. Sometimes there is no exact answer when
								researching code. When researching about history, science or politics, there is only one answer and much
								like a coder, the facts must be put together into a report that can be understood by everybody and can convey
								the thoughts of the writer. I’ve learned to try and adapt this mentality when writing effective code.<br>
								Being someone with a writing background and little coding experience, I’ve tried to implement systems
								that I already use into a tool that will help write more effective code.<br>

      					<strong>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can </strong> 
      					<strong>use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance).</strong> <br>
      							By customizing my html markup, I could easily insert a video component. 
      							I could insert and utilize video specific HTML markup. This would allow video to be inserted into my page, which would 
      							make access to the information on my site more accessible to a wider audience.I could also add captioning to a video through html.

						<strong>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what</strong> 
								are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?
								One of the common frustrations seems to be not being able to access youtube with a screenreader. I’m not sure how you could fix this problem. 
								It seems that there’s an audio alternative when prompted, but when the page refreshes, there is still no audio accessible option. 
								The user would need to find an alternative that is more user friendly when it comes to visual or hearing impairment. 
								One could use these shortcomings to create a better video service like Youtube that provides better access with a more 
								effective screenreader for this medium.
						<strong>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong>

								AT & T currently has a media kit containing two apps that assist with accessibility. It focuses mainly on the visually impaired. 
								The two cross-platform applications are called Mobile Speak and Mobile Magnifier.
								
						<strong>Mobile Speak</strong>-Is a basic screen reader app that guides the user through the interface using audio cues.

						<strong>Mobile Magnifier-</strong>This application allows the user to adjust their screen in a variety of ways including magnification and
								the adjusting of the color spectrum for better accessibility by the visually impaired
						<strong>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong>

								Freedom Scientific has developed a braille reader for the blind that interacts with your computer through Bluetooth. It’s an excellent 
								example of innovation in accessibility for the visually impaired.

								NCH software has a product called Debut. It is screen capture software designed to capture video from a variety of source and allows 
								that video to have things such as captions added to the videos.
								You can also add time stamps, change the color and burn directly to a dvd if need be. I can see how this would help in areas such as 
								education and training where the ability to make these adjustments would not only benefit the visually impaired, but also allow users 
								to convey thoughts and ideas in a way that plain text never could.

									VFW with Jen McCarrick<br>

						<strong>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.? Japan? Great Britain?</strong><br>
								From the MobiThinking website comes these statistics for most popular apps in the US.<br>
								We like our games<br>
								Distimo (2012 Year in review): The most downloaded apps are<br>
								Games (33 percent);<br>
								Widgets (8 percent);<br>
								Entertainment (7 percent);<br>
								Social (5 percent);<br>
								Lifestyle; music; photography; productivity (all 4 percent);<br>
								Tools; communication; utilities (all 3 percent).<br>
						<strong>Games also dominate app revenues.</strong><br>
								• Portio Research (April 2013) calculates: top categories (by number of apps) on the Apple App Store:<br>
								Games (17 percent of all apps in store);<br>
								Google Play: games (15 percent);<br>
								BlackBerry World: books (15 percent)<br>
								Games (9 percent);<br>
								Windows Phone Store: entertainment (19 percent)<br>
								Tools & productivity (15 percent)<br>
								Games (12 percent).
						<strong>The second most popular app category, overall, after games is messaging apps, also known as over-the-top (OTT) apps, according to Portio.</strong><br>
								It is estimated that there are at least 1 billion OTT messaging apps users around the world. The most popular of these are: Facebook Messenger (700 million users worldwide);<br>
								WeChat (300 million);<br>
								What’sApp (200 million);<br>
								Viber (175 million);<br>
								Line (100 million);<br>Kakao Talk (70 million);<br>
								BBM (60 million);<br>
								iMesssage (45 million);<br>
								ChatON (10 million);<br>
								Skype (10 million).<br>

						<strong>Japan</strong><br>

								It was interesting to see the different types of apps and which ones are more popular in the differing regions of the world.<br> 
								What did surprise me, was the difference in app popularity in China and Japan. Although they are in close proximity, and share a similar culture,<br> 
								the apps that are most popular were on different ends of the spectrum.<br>

								Studies show that in Japan, utility and productivity apps were the most popular category of downloaded apps.<br>
								These are apps like weather, geolocation or any app that would help improve daily life through technology.<br>
								This would be extremely useful when determining what apps to produce for what market when thinking globally.<br>

						<strong>The Uk</strong><br>

								From the same study, it shows that arcade and action games on the android market were the most popular category of downloaded apps in the UK.
								Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?

								I might infer that there are definite differences on what apps are more popular in different parts of the world. These fluxuations might have a lot to do with culture. How the customs, traditions and core values of a society affect its citizens, will determine what apps they use and what they use them for. This information would be invaluable as a developer. It would give clear direction when thinking about what apps would have success in producing apps in a global market.

						<strong>What is the average cost and bandwidth limit per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</strong><br>
								From the maximum PC website (Loub, 2013) comes these statistics regarding bandwidth restrictions around the world.<br>
						<strong>Cost and bandwidth limits per user in:</strong>
								The US-From the top three providers that were listed, AT & T, Comcast and Cox,<br>
								The largest amount of bandwidth available was 250 gigabytes per month.<br>
								The cost usually starts at around $20-$35 per month and increase in cost relative to the increased usage and is different for each company.<br>
						<strong>Japan-</strong><br>
								Here is an excerpt from the MaximumPC websites article on Japanese bandwidth pricing and limits information.<br>

								It’s difficult to pinpoint down bandwidth limits in Japan, primarily as a result of this writer’s inability to speak Japanese,<br>
								but we have managed to track down a few key details as to how Internet usage rates are set up.<br> 
								Japanese carrier NTT Communications posts a warning to users on its OCN Hikari fiber-optic service (whose monthly cost ranges from approximately $48 to $82),<br>
								noting that the company will consider restricting the use of anyone who pushes past 30 gigabytes of daily transfers. Think about that for a second: <strong>30 gigabytes</strong><br>
								aaa. That’s almost an allowance of a terabyte of bandwidth per month. What are you going to download? The Internet?<br>
								As far as we can tell, Japanese service provider ASAHI Net offers no bandwidth limitations for users of its DSL services—including download speeds of up to 50 Mbps and upload speeds of up to 5 Mbps for anywhere from $32 to $48 monthly.”<br>

						<strong>The UK</strong><br>
								From the top providers that were listed, AOL, BT and Virgin Media, there are packages that provide unlimited bandwidth but vary on pricing. Generally, the prices start in the $20 range and can go as high as $80 month.

						<strong>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</strong><br>
								As a developer armed with this information, I would think that if I wanted to produce apps that would target a global market, I would need to produce more than one app. 
						<strong>My first choice would be </strong>to develop a mash-up app that would include a utility portion such as camera, weather and geolocation, with lifestyle and entertainment potion such as show times, club events with their times and locations. I would deploy this app to the Asian market, specifically Japan and China where studies show these types of apps are most popular. 
								In the Full-sail library I found an article on the re-development on New York City’s online homework website (Braun, 2010) called HowmeworkNYC Apps (BigAppleOnlineLibrary). It’s a suite of tools designed to provide around the clock help to the 1.3 million children and teens that are served by the library. 
								The development team realized that the system was primarily being used by adults and not the children and teen age group that it was intended for. The team revamped the system and incorporated social media and found a dramatic increase I the library’s resources by the target age group.<br>

						<strong>My second choice would be</strong> to develop an app that would integrate itself into the gaming platform somehow. Host a mobile website in the idea of Gamefly. Organize, purchase and deliver games to users. Organize their gaming options. You could think of different ideas focused around the central gaming theme without being a game developer. 
								Studies show that gaming apps in the Northern hemisphere are the most popular and developing an app that focuses on this trend would be the wisest choice when developing a deployment strategy.<br>
